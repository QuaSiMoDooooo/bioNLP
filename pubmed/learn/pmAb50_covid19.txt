Non-synonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike region affect cell entry, 
tropism, and immune evasion, while frequent synonymous mutations may modify 
viral fitness. Host microRNAs, a type of non-coding RNA, play a crucial role in 
the viral life cycle, influencing viral replication and the host immune response 
directly or indirectly. Recently, we identified ten miRNAs with a high 
complementary capacity to target various regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We 
filtered our candidate miRNAs to those only expressed with documented expression 
in SARS-CoV-2 target cells, with an additional focus on miRNAs that have been 
reported in other viral infections. We determined if mutations in the first 
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern affected these miRNA binding sites. Out of ten 
miRNA binding sites, five were negatively impacted by mutations, with three 
recurrent synonymous mutations present in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages with 
high-frequency NSP3: C3037U and NSP4: G9802U/C9803U. These mutations were 
predicted to negatively affect the binding ability of miR-197-5p and miR-18b-5p, 
respectively. In these preliminary findings, using a dual-reporter assay system, 
we confirmed the ability of these miRNAs in binding to the predicted NSP3 and 
NSP4 regions and the loss/reduced miRNA bindings due to the recurrent mutations.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems and healthcare 
workers (HCWs) faced significant demands and unique challenges. In this 
qualitative study, we explore the effects of the COVID-19 public health policies 
on British Columbia's frontline HCWs, describe what worked in the management of 
the pandemic, and elucidate the lessons learned that could be applied to future 
pandemic preparedness, recovery and response.
METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study is part of a larger, national 
multi-case study on pandemic policy communication and uptake. Semi-structured 
interviews were conducted from November 2020- June 2021 with fourteen HCWs 
working in long-term care (LTC), acute care and public health settings. Data 
were inductively coded, and analyzed following a resilience framework for public 
health emergency preparedness, which emphasizes the essential elements of a 
public health system, vital to all phases of health emergency management, 
readiness, response and recovery.
RESULTS: HCWs experienced confusion, frustration, uncertainty, anxiety, fatigue 
and stress, during the pandemic and detailed challenges that affected policy 
implementation. This included communication and coordination inconsistencies 
between the province and regional health authorities; lack of involvement of 
frontline staff in pandemic planning; inadequate training and support; 
inadequate personal protective equipment resource capacity and mobilization; and 
staffing shortages. HCWs recommended increased collaboration between frontline 
staff and policy makers, investment in preparing and practicing pandemic plans, 
and the need for training in emergency management and infection prevention and 
control.
CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic planning, response and recovery should include inputs from 
actors/key stakeholders at the provincial, regional and local levels, to 
facilitate better coordination, communication and outcomes. Also, given the 
critical roles of frontline HCWs in policy implementation, they should be 
adequately supported and consideration must be given to how they interpret and 
act on policies. Bi-directional communication channels should be incorporated 
between policymakers and frontline HCWs to verify the appropriate adoption of 
policies, reflective learning, and to ensure policy limitations are being 
communicated and acted upon by policy makers.

mRNA-based drugs have tremendous potential as clinical treatments, however, a 
major challenge in realizing this drug class will promise to develop methods for 
safely delivering the bioactive agents with high efficiency and without 
activating the immune system. With regard to mRNA vaccines, researchers have 
modified the mRNA structure to enhance its stability and promote systemic 
tolerance of antigenic presentation in non-inflammatory contexts. Still, 
delivery of naked modified mRNAs is inefficient and results in low levels of 
antigen protein production. As such, lipid nanoparticles have been utilized to 
improve delivery and protect the mRNA cargo from extracellular degradation. This 
advance was a major milestone in the development of mRNA vaccines and dispelled 
skepticism about the potential of this technology to yield clinically approved 
medicines. Following the resounding success of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, many 
other mRNA-based drugs have been proposed for the treatment of a variety of 
diseases. This review begins with a discussion of mRNA modifications and 
delivery vehicles, as well as the factors that influence administration routes. 
Then, we summarize the potential applications of mRNA-based drugs and discuss 
further key points pertaining to preclinical and clinical development of mRNA 
drugs targeting a wide range of diseases. Finally, we discuss the latest market 
trends and future applications of mRNA-based drugs.

COVID-19 ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), caused by 
SARS-CoV-2, involves a decrease in the end expiratory lung volume (EELV), 
compliance, and hypoxemia. The authors retrospectively analysed the relationship 
between the EELV, Plateau pressure (Pplat), and compliance of the respiratory 
system in a group of 21 mechanically ventilated COVID ARDS patients with 
moderate to severe hypoxia who were subjected to a recruitment manoeuvre. 
Further, these parameters were studied after dividing them into two groups as 
Group 1 of clinically non-recruitable and Group 2 of clinically recruitable 
patients. There was relationship between EELV, compliance, and Pplat among those 
patients who were clinically recruited versus those who were not in a 
homogeneous group of COVID ARDS patients. In Group 1, the statistical value of 
EELV and compliance were r = 0.395, p>0.05, EELV and Pplat were r = 0.021, 
p>0.05, and compliance and Pplat were r = -0.848, p<0.001. In Group 2, the 
statistical values of EELV and compliance were (r = 0.605, p<0.001), EELV and 
Pplat were r = -0.391, p<0.05, compliance and Pplat were r = -0.848, p<0.001. 
The additional information gained after understanding this relationship can help 
to optimise ventilator settings. Key Words: COVID, ARDS, End expiratory lung 
volume, Plateau pressure, Compliance, Recruitment, Ventilation.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse potential molecular mechanisms and identify potential 
therapeutic regimens and drugs to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Crohn's disease (CD) through bioinformatics and 
systems biology.
STUDY DESIGN: Bioinformatics Study. Place and Duration of the Study: Jiading 
District Central Hospital Affiliated Shanghai University of Medicine & Health 
Sciences, Shanghai, China, from May to December 2022.
METHODOLOGY: The common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CD and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified using two RNA-seq datasets (GSE147507, 
GSE153974) extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Subsequently, 
functional enrichment, pathway analysis, and candidate drug analysis were 
performed using these DEGs.
RESULTS: In total, 44 DEGs were identified as common between CD and SARS-CoV-2 
infection. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, hub 
genes were identified, and critical modules were determined by means of 
bioinformatics and combinatorial statistical approaches. Functional and pathway 
analyses conducted under ontological conditions showed a common association 
between CD and infection with SARS-CoV-2. The common DEGs were then used to 
identify coregulatory networks of interactions between transcriptional factors 
and genes, between proteins and medicines, and between DEGs and miRNAs.
CONCLUSION: Top 10 hub genes including IL6, CXCL1, CSF2, CXCL2, CXCL5, MMP3, 
PTGS2, CXCL3, SELE, and LCN2 were identified, which may function as potential 
candidate targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, the identification of 
certain promising treatment drugs for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and CD 
was also made.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) continues to be one of the most 
life-threatening conditions for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The 
2023 European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines on ARDS: definition, 
phenotyping and respiratory support strategies (2023 Guideline) update the 2017 
An Official American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care 
Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: 
mechanical ventilation in adult patients with ARDS (2017 Guideline), including 7 
aspects of 3 topics of definitions, phenotyping, and respiratory support 
strategies [including high flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNO), non-invasive 
ventilation (NIV), neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), extracorporeal life 
support (ECLS), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with recruitment 
maneuvers (RM), tidal volume (VT), and prone positioning]. 2023 Guideline review 
and summarize the literature since the publication of the 2017 Guideline, 
covering ARDS and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, as well as ARDS caused by 
novel coronavirus infection. Based on the most recent medical evidence, the 2023 
Guideline provide clinicians with new ideas and approaches for nonpharmacologic 
respiratory support strategies for adults with ARDS. This article provides 
interpretation of the new concepts, the new approaches, the new recommended 
grading and new levels of evidence for ARDS in the 2023 Guideline.

When the COVID-19 pandemic subsided, the war in Ukraine led to further 
disruptions in consumers' daily behaviours, with rising prices for food and 
energy. We conducted a survey study on self-reported changes in food-related 
consumer behaviour in ten European countries and compared the results to a 
similar study conducted two years ago. A latent class cluster analysis 
distinguished five clusters and showed that different types of consumers can be 
distinguished based on how they react to the crisis as regards their eating 
habits. 19% of survey participants reported no major changes, and 32% reported 
changes mostly in terms of more price sensitivity. Among those that reported 
changes beyond reacting to higher prices, there are indications of more mindful 
eating and more deliberate choices. The changes already found earlier in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic therefore seem to have been strengthened and 
supplemented by reactions to price increases. The results present a challenge to 
the food industry in terms of supplying healthy and sustainable food at 
affordable prices.

BACKGROUND: The first COVID-19 lockdown decreed in Spain by the government 
resulted in a significant disruption in the daily lives of youth that may have 
affected their mental health. The aim of this study was to identify factors that 
influenced youth mental health during this period.
METHODS: Between March and May 2020, a sample of 1205 youths (age range 18-24 
years) from across Spain completed a questionnaire that assessed 
sociodemographic, mental health, loneliness, coping with humour and healthy 
habits. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling.
RESULTS: The proposed model showed good fit values, and significant variables 
explained 37% of mental health. loneliness, coping humour, healthy and unhealthy 
habits, and gender significantly predicted youth mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of the pandemic and confinement derived from 
COVID-19 seemed to be especially severe for youth, increasing their mental 
health vulnerability. It is recommended that evaluating the long-term effects of 
confinement on this population, the mental health needs they may have and the 
support resources that would help meet them in situations of isolation, paying 
special attention to females.

PURPOSE: Despite the extensive vaccination campaigns in many countries, COVID-19 
is still a major worldwide health problem because of its associated morbidity 
and mortality. Therefore, finding efficient treatments as fast as possible is a 
pressing need. Drug repurposing constitutes a convenient alternative when the 
need for new drugs in an unexpected medical scenario is urgent, as is the case 
with COVID-19.
METHODS: Using data from a central registry of electronic health records (the 
Andalusian Population Health Database), the effect of prior consumption of drugs 
for other indications previous to the hospitalization with respect to patient 
outcomes, including survival and lymphocyte progression, was studied on a 
retrospective cohort of 15,968 individuals, comprising all COVID-19 patients 
hospitalized in Andalusia between January and November 2020.
RESULTS: Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios and analysis of lymphocyte progression 
curves support a significant association between consumption of 21 different 
drugs and better patient survival. Contrarily, one drug, furosemide, displayed a 
significant increase in patient mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we have taken advantage of the availability of a 
regional clinical database to study the effect of drugs, which patients were 
taking for other indications, on their survival. The large size of the database 
allowed us to control covariates effectively.

Preventing vector-borne diseases (VBDs) mainly relies on effective vector 
control tools and strategies, which in turn depend on population acceptance and 
adherence. Inspired by the abundant recent literature on SARS-COV-2, we 
investigate the relationship between risk perception and preventive behaviour 
for selected VBDs and the extent to which risk perception is determined by 
social norms. We use cross-sectional data collected from 497 individuals in four 
regions of Guyana in 2017. We use a conditional mixed process estimator with 
multilevel coefficients, estimated through a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) 
framework, applying a simultaneous equation structure. We find robust results on 
malaria: risk perception was significantly influenced by the risk perception of 
the reference group across different definitions of the reference group, hinting 
at the existence of social norms. Risk perception significantly increased the 
likelihood of passive behaviour by 4.48%. Less clear-cut results were found for 
dengue. This study applies quantitative social science methods to public health 
issues in the context of VBDs. Our findings point to the relevance of tailoring 
communications on health risks for VBDs to groups defined at the intersection of 
socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Such tailored strategies are 
expected to align risk perception among reference groups and boost preventive 
behaviour.

COVID-19 is linked to endotheliopathy and coagulopathy, which can result in 
multi-organ failure. The mechanisms causing endothelial damage due to severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain elusive. Here, we 
developed an infection-competent human vascular organoid from pluripotent stem 
cells for modeling endotheliopathy. Longitudinal serum proteome analysis 
identified aberrant complement signature in critically ill patients driven by 
the amplification cycle regulated by complement factor B and D (CFD). This 
deviant complement pattern initiates endothelial damage, neutrophil activation, 
and thrombosis specific to organoid-derived human blood vessels, as verified 
through intravital imaging. We examined a new long-acting, pH-sensitive 
(acid-switched) antibody targeting CFD. In both human and macaque COVID-19 
models, this long-acting anti-CFD monoclonal antibody mitigated abnormal 
complement activation, protected endothelial cells, and curtailed the innate 
immune response post-viral exposure. Collectively, our findings suggest that the 
complement alternative pathway exacerbates endothelial injury and inflammation. 
This underscores the potential of CFD-targeted therapeutics against severe 
viral-induced inflammathrombotic outcomes.

The health burden due to mental health has historically been underestimated with 
focus on communicable diseases and deaths and little consideration of disability 
and comorbidity effects of poor mental health. Recent data show increasing 
trends of mental health disorders as a share of global health burdens and 
vulnerability of adolescents. This paper aims to explore social determinants of 
mental health as experienced by adolescent girls, drawing attention to gendered 
risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with twenty-two 
adolescent girls in urban informal settlements in Kenya and Nigeria reveal 
unique environmental, socio-cultural, economic and educational factors that 
threatened their mental wellbeing. The pandemic exacerbated these determinants. 
An equitable recovery will require a consideration of not only disproportional 
mental health outcomes, but also social determinants that contribute to these 
outcomes. As more than half of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa reside 
in informal settlements, this study has implications for youth-focused mental 
health interventions in these and similar settings.

BACKGROUND: Even with the mild form of COVID-19, people need to practice the 
proper preventive measures to achieve health, safety and control spread of 
infection. Few studies assessed sound disinfection and rehabilitative knowledge. 
This study aims to assess the self-reported, knowledge of specific disinfection 
measures among post-recovery COVID-19 patients and identifying the most 
requested knowledge items regarding the prevention and post COVID rehabilitation 
measures.
METHODS: This is an exploratory cross-sectional study using an electronically 
open survey. A pre-tested e-questionnaire was employed for data assembling. The 
sample size was calculated and a total of 417 people completed the 
questionnaire. Knowledge score was calculated for preventive and disinfection 
measures during and after COVID 19 infection. It comprised three sections: 
socio-demographics, study participants' knowledge regarding precautions, 
disinfection, and rehabilitation measures, as well as sources of knowledge about 
COVID-19.
RESULTS: All participants infected with COVID-19 (82%) reported self-isolation 
for ten days after confirming the infection, with only 18% required 
hospitalization. Regarding the information needed by the participants, the 
highest requests were for the rehabilitation information after COVID-19 and 
preventive measures. Females under 30 years old and those with a college 
education or higher were significantly more likely to request rehabilitation 
information after COVID-19 (P-value 0.05). Nevertheless, males were 
significantly more interested in information regarding preventive measures; They 
were over 30 years old and had education below university (P-value 0.05). 
Participants (above 30 years old) had significantly higher knowledge of 
preventive and disinfection measures during and after COVID-19 infection (P = 
0.030).
CONCLUSION: After the COVID-19 experience, most participants demonstrated a 
great desire for rehabilitation information and proper preventive measures. This 
paves the way for delivering self-management and rehabilitation knowledge and 
emphasizing the significance of various prevention modalities.

IMPORTANCE: Multiple cases of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases after 
COVID-19 have been reported. However, their incidences and risks have rarely 
been quantified.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidences and risks of autoimmune and 
autoinflammatory connective tissue disorders after COVID-19.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective population-based 
study conducted between October 8, 2020, and December 31, 2021, that used 
nationwide data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency COVID-19 
National Health Insurance Service cohort and included individuals who received a 
diagnosis of COVID-19 via polymerase chain reaction testing and a control group 
with no evidence of COVID-19 identified from National Health Insurance Service 
of Korea cohort. Data analysis was conducted from September 2022 to August 2023.
EXPOSURES: Receipt of diagnosis of COVID-19.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the incidence and risk of 
autoimmune and autoinflammatory connective tissue disorders following COVID-19. 
A total of 32 covariates, including demographics, socioeconomic statuses, 
lifestyle factors, and comorbidity profiles, were balanced through inverse 
probability weighting. The incidences and risks of autoimmune and 
autoinflammatory connective tissue disorders were compared between the groups 
using multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 354 527 individuals with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 52.24 
[15.55] years; 179 041 women [50.50%]) and 6 134 940 controls (mean [SD] age, 
52.05 [15.63] years; 3 074 573 women [50.12%]) were included. The risks of 
alopecia areata (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19), alopecia 
totalis (aHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.39-2.17), antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibody-associated vasculitis (aHR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.65), Crohn disease 
(aHR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.31-2.15), and sarcoidosis (aHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.00-2.52) 
were higher in the COVID-19 group. The risks of alopecia totalis, psoriasis, 
vitiligo, vasculitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
adult-onset Still disease, Sjögren syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, and 
sarcoidosis were associated with the severity of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 was 
associated with a substantial risk for autoimmune and autoinflammatory 
connective tissue disorders, indicating that long-term management of patients 
with COVID-19 should include evaluation for such disorders.

Introduction. Brazil was one of the most affected countries by the COVID-19 
pandemic. Instituto Adolfo Lutz (IAL) is the reference laboratory for COVID-19 
in São Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil. In April 2020, a secondary 
diagnostic pole named IAL-2 was created to enhance IAL's capacity for COVID-19 
diagnosis.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Public health laboratories must be prepared 
to rapidly respond to emerging epidemics or pandemics.Aim. To describe the 
design of IAL-2 and correlate the results of RT-qPCR tests for COVID-19 with 
secondary data on suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the São Paulo 
state.Methodology. This is a retrospective study based on the analysis of 
secondary data from patients suspected of infection by SARS-CoV-2 whose clinical 
samples were submitted to real-time PCR after reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) at 
IAL-2, between 1 April 2020 and 8 March 2022. RT-qPCR Ct results of the 
different kits used were also analysed.Results. IAL-2 was implemented in April 
2020, just over a month after the detection of the first COVID-19 case in 
Brazil. The laboratory performed 304,250 RT-qPCR tests during the study period, 
of which 98 319 (32.3 %) were positive, 205827 (67.7 %) negative, and 104 
(0.03 %) inconclusive for SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR Ct values≤30 for E/N genes of 
SARS-CoV-2 were presented by 79.7 % of all the samples included in the 
study.Conclusion. IAL was able to rapidly implement a new laboratory structure 
to support the processing of an enormous number of samples for diagnosis of 
COVID-19, outlining strategies to carry out work with quality, using different 
RT-qPCR protocols.

The pandemic of COVID-19 is a traumatic event with distressing implications for 
mental health and several aspects of life. This study aimed to assess 
Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
among patients who experienced mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and their household 
contacts. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between May 2020 
and November 2020, in Ismailia and Suez governorates. A convenient sampling 
method was used. The sample size was calculated according to the prevalence of 
PTSD in COVID-19 patients to be 200 adult participants from both sexes, 100 
patients with history of recent COVID-19 infection (up to 2 months after 
recovery) and their close family. COVID-19 was confirmed by a nasal swab sample 
tested by PCR in addition to suggestive symptoms and/or positive computed 
tomography lung findings. Data was collected by using the Arabic version of the 
Post-Traumatic Stress disorder checklist 5 (PCL5-PTSD) and the Arabic version of 
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The questionnaire was collected through 
interviews at the Endemic and Infectious diseases and Family medicine outpatient 
clinics. Of the 200 studied participants, evidence of PTSD was found in 112 
(56%) participants; all COVID-19 cases and 12 of their close-contact relatives. 
Impaired HRQoL was evident in 107 (53.5%) participants; all the COVID-19 cases 
and 7 contacts. The mean values total scores of the PTSD and HRQoL and its 
domains were significantly higher among cases compared to their contacts. The 
most frequently impaired domain was social (55%), psychological (54.5%), 
impairment (53.5%) followed by physical (48.5%) and the least was health 
perception (33.5%). The mean values of PTSD, HRQoL and their domains were 
significantly higher among participants who recalled respiratory symptoms and 
who had comorbid illness. The odds ratio of PTSD and HRQoL was 0.27 (95% CI: 
0.2-0.36) and 0.3 (95% CI: 0.23-0.39) in participants who had more than a case 
of COVID-19 within their families. All the studied COVID-19 participants showed 
PTSD and impaired HRQoL, compared to 12% and 7% of their contacts, respectively. 
Past COVID-19 was associated with impairment of all domains of HRQoL and the 
most affected were the physical, psychological and impairment domains.

Vaccination against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cornerstone 
of reducing morbidity and mortality of this disease, as it has been shown to 
decrease the risk of viral transmission, severity of disease, hospitalization, 
and intubation. However, true understanding of its impact is skewed by 
heterogeneous vaccine administration due to lack of equitable access, vaccine 
hesitancy, and varying social determinants of health. Therefore, this study aims 
to identify groups that are less likely to be vaccinated and understand whether 
the resultant differences in vaccination rates affect morbidity and mortality in 
socially marginalized COVID-19 patients. A retrospective cohort analysis was 
performed on a randomized and stratified population of 939 COVID-19 patients 
from January 2021 to December 2021. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression 
were used to assess demographic and clinical characteristic trends in 
unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated groups. No one age (P = 
.21), gender (P = .9), race (P = .12), ethnicity (P = .09), or health insurance 
status (P = .13) group was more vaccinated than the other. Similarly, no 
subgroup was at increased odds of intubation (P = .08) or death. However, 
patients with all categories of comorbidities including cardiopulmonary disease 
(P = <.001, effect size .17), renal disease (P = <.001, effect size 0.138), 
metabolic disease (P = .04), and immunocompromised (P = .01) states were found 
to have significantly higher vaccination rates. Our study also shows that full 
vaccination protects against mortality and decreases the odds of intubation by 
55% (adjusted odds ratio = 0.453, P value = .015) compared to no vaccination or 
partial vaccination. Findings from this study show an encouraging trend that 
sicker patients had higher rates of vaccination against COVID-19. This trend 
highlights the need for further identification of motivators that may be applied 
to vaccine-hesitant populations, which can help guide population-level policy, 
increase vaccination campaign yield, and reach for health equity.

We described the proportion of adherence to the scheduled visual field (VF) 
examination and the associated factors in glaucoma patients in a tertiary 
referral center during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in 
Taiwan. Patients with scheduled VF examinations during May 25th to July 12th, 
2021, were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical characteristics including type of 
glaucoma, intraocular pressure (IOP) at the day of arranging VF examinations, 
prescriptions of anti-glaucoma medications, non-medical glaucoma treatment, 
length of glaucoma history, mean deviation (MD) of VF defect, and announcement 
of glaucoma progression were recorded. The associations between the adherence 
and the clinical factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression. There were 204 patients included, of which 37 patients (18.14%) 
adhered to VF examinations. A total of 161 patients (78.9%) were diagnosed with 
open-angle glaucoma (OAG), 27 patients (13.2%) with angle closure glaucoma, and 
16 patients (7.8%) with glaucoma suspect. Most of the participants (41.2%) had 
mild VF defect and had been prescribed with no more than 1 bottle of 
anti-glaucoma medication. In the multivariate analysis, diagnosis of glaucoma 
suspect (P = .02) and history of SLT (P = .04) were significantly associated 
with better adherence. Glaucoma severity and the announcement of glaucoma 
progression were not significantly associated with adherence to VF examination. 
The COVID-19 pandemic had greatly influenced the adherence to VF examination in 
glaucoma patients. This study demonstrated that patients with the diagnosis of 
glaucoma suspect and history of SLT were more likely to adhere to VF 
examinations even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Republic.

Dyspepsia is one of the most common chronic digestive diseases, which is due to 
underlying organic causes that can be detected, or causes that cannot be 
detected called functional dyspepsia (FD). There is no epidemiological study to 
date that measures the prevalence and risk factors of the FD in low- and 
middle-income countries, so this international cross-sectional study was 
conducted in 15 low- and middle-income countries from data previously published 
its protocol NCT05340400. Participants were recruited in the period from 
22/April/2022 to 14/June/2022. The diagnosis of the FD was according to clinical 
manifestations. We determined the physical activity, daily stress, and fatigue 
of the participants. A large number of collaborators were chosen from different 
regions and institutions within each country to achieve diversity within the 
sample and reduce the probability of bias. Our study concluded that the 
prevalence of FD is much higher in low- and middle-income countries 37.9% 
[6.2%-44.2%], compared to high-income countries 10% [8%-12%], with a higher rate 
among the Afro-Caribbean race 47.9%. Sudan obtained the highest prevalence 
44.3%, then Egypt 41.4%, while the lowest prevalence was in Algeria 25.7%. 
Moreover, there are many risk factors, including modifiable ones, such as severe 
stress, chronic fatigue, smoking, abnormal BMI, insufficient or too many hours 
of sleep, and previous infection with Covid-19, and non-modifiable ones such as 
advanced age, chronic diseases, and female sex. Highlighting the prevalence and 
increasing risk factors of FD in low- and middle-income countries should draw 
the attention of those responsible for health care in these countries and reduce 
the risk factors.

Ethical Considerations of Replacing Clinical Hours With Simulation in 
Undergraduate Nursing Education: Means to an End, or an End in Itself?

In the current health-care environment, undergraduate nursing programs are 
expected to provide high-quality clinical experiences for students despite 
increasing difficulty accessing clinical placements. Expectations for newly 
graduated nurses have increased in the last few years, with an emphasis on 
"work-ready" graduates. At the same time, the availability of a variety of 
clinical practicum placements has decreased in some areas, increasing the 
difficulty of meeting the increasing numbers of nursing students required for 
future workforce planning, a situation exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 
global pandemic. Nursing educators are caught between industry requirements for 
clinically prepared students and the regulatory requirements of their 
educational institutions. One solution being espoused internationally is 
substituting simulation for clinical practicum hours. Simulation offers many 
advantages, especially for patient safety, providing students with opportunities 
to link theory to practice in a controlled environment. This article discusses 
the ethical considerations of substituting simulation for clinical hours in 
undergraduate nursing education. Is this substitution justified as a means to an 
end or an end in itself?

Background: The virtual environment has democratized information and research in 
the health area, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic. Purpose: This study analyzed the boosting strategies of social 
networks and identified the most accessed posts from a previously developed and 
validated information portal aimed at people with disabilities. Methods: This 
quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, exploratory study used Google 
Analytics® to collect data on origins and access numbers; boost data were 
obtained from the Facebook® and Instagram® networks themselves, after the end of 
each boost. Conclusions: Greater interest in publications related to the 
acquisition of rights for persons with disabilities and about COVID-19 was 
identified. The virtual environment, especially social networks in Brazil, 
proved to be a useful tool for disseminating information during the COVID-19 
pandemic, highlighting the importance of boosting access to health information. 
In addition, the investment in social networks was relevant due to the increase 
in the number of followers on the page. Implications for Practice: Social 
networks can be a valuable means of disseminating research, improving access to 
information based on scientific evidence in an inclusive way.

How to Improve Collaboration Between General Practitioners and Clinical 
Psychologists for Their Patients' Common Mental Health Problems in Primary Care 
Context?

Avenue Dr G. Therasse, 1, B-5530 Yvoir, Belgium, brice.lepiece@uclouvain.be.

BACKGROUND: Mental health problems have become a major topic of public health 
these last years, particularly since the pandemic of COVID-19. Primary care 
givers are confronted with high rates of common mental health problems (CMHPs) 
in population. This questions healthcare organization and specifically 
collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and clinical psychologists 
(CPs). In this paper we aim to review recent literature to identify factors that 
facilitate or hinder collaboration between GPs and CPs when caring for their 
patients' CMHPs.
METHODS: A non-systematic qualitative literature review was performed, using the 
PRISMA method. We restricted the review to papers published between 2010 and 
2023.
RESULTS: We identified 52 papers and after filtering, only 6 were included in 
the synthesis. Six main themes were identified: barriers to interprofessional 
collaboration, lack of mutual trust, mutual dissatisfaction with information 
exchanged, the paradox of professional secrecy, the necessity of a paradigm 
shift, and conceptual frameworks of collaboration. These themes were discussed 
to improve collaboration between GPs and CPs.
CONCLUSION: This work provides some recommendations to support the development 
of interprofessional collaboration between GPs and CPs in primary care.

sjunja@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the mental health 
of medical personnel worldwide, leading to increased levels of anxiety and 
depression. This study aimed to compare anxiety and depression levels among 
healthcare workers during the initial wave of the pandemic in April-May 2020 and 
the post-pandemic period in January-May 2023 in Russia.
METHODS: Data from two similar surveys conducted during the respective periods 
were combined, and a case-control matching approach was used to ensure 
compatibility between the two samples. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) was used to assess anxiety and depression levels.
RESULTS: The mean total score for Anxiety subscale in 2020 was 4.126 
(SD = 3.042), and in 2023 it increased to 6.632 (SD = 4.132) (F=20.751, df (1, 
172), p<0.001, η2p=0.108). Similarly, the mean total score for Depression 
subscale increased from 3.253 (SD = 2.616) in 2020 to 4.115 (SD = 2.939) in 2023 
(F=4.177, df (1, 172), p=0.043, η2p=0.024). The proportion of healthcare workers 
with higher-than-normal levels of anxiety increased from 16.09% in 2020 to 
39.08% in 2023, whereas the effect size for depression remained negligible. The 
increase in anxiety severity was contrary to previous longitudinal studies 
showing a decrease in anxiety and depression levels after an initial increase 
during the pandemic.
CONCLUSION: The increase in anxiety and depression levels in healthcare workers 
in 2023 may be attributed to other factors like "special military operation" in 
Ukraine, sanctions, and announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022. 
These factors could be perceived as more serious adverse factors, leading to 
increased anxiety levels.

BACKGROUND: Emotional pressure, fear, and uncertainties affected healthcare 
workers (HCWs) who played a significant role during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 
the pandemic crisis, the consequences on the health of mental HealhCare Workers 
are still significant. Our work aimed to evaluate burnout and compassion fatigue 
in HCWs.
METHOD: In our observational study, 102 (65 females, 37 males) mental HCWs were 
evaluated during and post-COVID-19 pandemic. We used the Compassion 
Fatigue-Short Scale, Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale, and Beck Depression 
Inventory.
RESULTS: Subscale Secondary Trauma Stress of CF-SS demonstrated an increase in 
the rate in the post-pandemic phase (24.51% in all HCWs). The percentage reached 
in males was high (37.84%). Instead, the levels of Job Burnout remained constant 
in the two periods analyzed (during and post-COVID-19). Depressive symptoms 
remained constant with a prevalence in females of the post-COVID period.
CONCLUSION: The results confirm increased stress secondary to the traumatic 
event, while the levels of job burnout are high. Closely associated with 
compassion fatigue are levels of empathy that were found to be unchanged.

COVID, the Main Cause of Mysery of Teenager? Retrospective Study of 
Hospitalizations of 15-25 in Psychosomatics (2018-2022).

BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an apparent increase 
in the utilization of mental health services and psychiatric disorders among 
youth. However, there is little data on youth mental health prior to the 
pandemic. Some authors suggest that the increase in the use of psychiatric care 
started before. Are we facing a recent phenomenon initiated by the pandemic that 
will disappear with it, or did it highlight an older issue? Have the profiles of 
the young people and the care provided changed since the pandemic?
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of the hospitalization records of 
patients aged 15 to 25. The inclusion period extends from January 1, 2018, to 
December 31, 2022.
RESULTS: There was an increase in the number of young people hospitalized from 
September 2020 to February 2021, suggesting a delayed effect of Covid's impact. 
44% of young people were hospitalized through emergency services, number that 
has increased. There has been an increase in prior psychiatric care and 
hospitalizations among patients hospitalized since the beginning of the 
pandemic. 49% attribute their condition to family issues. Upon discharge, many 
patients were on medication, but there has been no significant change in 
prescriptions since the pandemic began. The majority of patients were referred 
to their primary care physician, psychologist, and psychiatrist, which has not 
changed since the pandemic began.
CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the increase in hospitalizations, the rest of the 
practices within the institution has remained unchanged, suggesting that there 
are few differences in issues brought by patients since the start of the 
pandemic. Difficulties related to the family environment remain the primary 
reason for hospitalization requests. We do not have clear evidence of a 
worsening situation, which tends to support the hypothesis that COVID-19 has 
been a catalyst for a pre-existing state.

marenza.m@virgilio.it.

BACKGROUND: WHO has decreed an end to the pandemic crisis from COVID-19. 
However, the consequences of stress, compassion fatigue, and healthcare workers' 
expectations are still evident. Also, the hope of ending the problems associated 
with the pandemic is still present, although the awareness of maintaining a high 
level of attention is current in the HCWs.
METHOD: In our observational study, 102 (65 females, 37 males) mental healthcare 
workers were evaluated during and post-COVID-19 pandemic. They were divided into 
different categories of workers: nurses, physicians, psychologists, social 
assistants, social educators, social health workers, and psychiatric 
rehabilitation technicians. We used the ProQoL for compassion fatigue, 
compassion satisfaction, and burnout; BHS for hopelessness.
RESULTS: ProQoL data showed a significant increase in compassion satisfaction in 
post-pandemic (p=0.002) in all professional workers. The same results in burnout 
and secondary stress subscales (respectively, p=0.018, p=0.000) are evident. The 
BHS total score indicated that the difference between T0 vs. T1 was not 
statistically significant (p=0.109).
CONCLUSIONS: The collected data during and post-COVID-19 pandemic showed reduced 
burnout and compassion fatigue in the helping professions. However, in the 
periods analyzed, no changes in hope are observed.

Surgery and Medical Sciences, University "Magna Graecia", Catanzaro, Italy,

In the pandemic period due to the strong restrictions made necessary to deal 
with the spread of the Sars COVID-19 Virus, adolescents were the subjects who, 
most of all, suffered from isolation and lack of sociality, due to social 
distancing. It was necessary to change their habits, their lifestyles, the way 
they live social relationships and relate to others. Furthermore, those of them 
who were facing health difficulties at the time were faced with the 
impossibility of the services to guarantee safety conditions, so that in most 
cases many medical, psychiatric and psychological activities were suspended, 
with hospitalizations postponed to a date to be defined, appointments canceled 
with a high risk of losing contact with the patient. Many authors agreed, right 
from the start, that the pandemic consequences would have focused above all on 
psychological problems. The scientific literature on past pandemics had shown 
the role of fear, anxiety, stress and depression and its negative psychosocial 
consequences on the quality of life of the population. Samantha Brooks and 
colleagues from King's College London reviewed 24 studies on the psychological 
impact of quarantine and highlighted negative psychological effects including 
symptoms of post-traumatic stress, confusion and anger. Today there are many 
contributions in the literature which unfortunately confirm what has been 
hypothesized.

The Urge to Splurge in Time of COVID-19: Emotional Spending, Revenge Buying and 
Compulsive Shopping.

BACKGROUND: Shopping is a reality for all of us; it can also be a pleasure or a 
source of problem, depending on the psychology behind it and our decision 
making. Furthermore, our spending patterns were seriously shaken and impacted by 
the COVID pandemic; restrictions, safety measures and lockdown generated changes 
in the way we buy. So, what has changed and why?
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between January 2023 and May 2023, a literature search 
based on electronic bibliographic databases as well as other sources of 
information (grey literature) was conducted in order to investigate the most 
recent data on shopping habits and especially how they were impacted by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: Various shopping behaviors observed post COVID, such as the urge to 
splurge, emotional spending, revenge buying and problematic shopping behavior, 
can be read and explained via psychology. Customers's socio-demographic 
characteristics play considerable roles in new buying patterns, but some general 
changes show that online shopping and contactless payment have certainly 
increased, consumers are more aware of their spending habits, looking for value 
first and not remaining loyal to brand, homebody economy has risen and money is 
rather spent on domestic tourism instead of foreign holidays.
CONCLUSIONS: A lot of buying habits have changed during COVID-19 and many of 
these modifications will remain in a post pandemic world. If many consumers 
gained some insight in their spending behaviors and are looking for durability 
and sustainability as preferred choices, luxury products will always attract 
clients. Shopping being emotionally driven, money should rather been spent on 
experiences (rather than things) and on others (rather than ourselves) in order 
to make happy.

Negative symptoms (NSs) and cognitive deficits (CDs) negatively affect patients' 
quality of life with primary psychosis. Our observational study evaluated the 
percentage of NSs in a group of inpatients of a psychiatric rehabilitation 
facility and the variation of the interaction with CDs during the COVID-19 
pandemic. The results showed a significant correlation between NSs and CDs in 
the first observation period (PANSS - FSNS p=0.001; BNSS p=0.023; Epitrack 
p=0.00) and a stabilization of the results between the first and second 
observation periods (PANSS - FSNS: p=0.094; BNSS p=0.466; Epitrack p=0.026).

BACKGROUND: Updated vaccine strategies are needed to protect against new 
SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased immune escape. Here, information on the 
safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated Omicron-adapted vaccine is 
presented, as compared with CoronaVac.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase III clinical trial 
was conducted to compare a modified Omicron-adapted vaccine (Omicron vaccine) 
with the authorized prototype vaccine (CoronaVac®) as a booster dose. Healthy 
adults aged ≥18 years, who have previously received 2 or 3 doses of CoronaVac 
(2C or 3C cohort) at least 6 months before, were enrolled to get a booster dose 
of Omicron vaccine or CoronaVac in a ratio of 2:1 (2C/3C+1O/1C). Back-up serums 
after two initial doses of CoronaVac (2C+0) for adults aged 26-45 years were 
collected from a previous study. Immunogenicity and safety data at 28 days after 
vaccination were collected and analyzed. One of the primary objectives was to 
evaluate the superiority of immunogenicity of Omicron vaccine booster against 
Omicron BA.1, compared with CoronaVac booster against BA.1. Another objective 
was to evaluate the non-inferiority of immunogenicity of Omicron vaccine booster 
against BA.1, compared with two initial doses of CoronaVac against ancestral 
strain.
RESULTS: Between June 1st and July 21st, 2022, a total of 1,500 healthy adults 
were enrolled. Results show that all pre-specified superiority criteria for BA.1 
neutralizing antibody were met. Specifically, within the 3C cohort (3C+1O vs. 
3C+1C), the geometric mean titers' (GMT) ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) 
was 1.64 (1.42, 1.89), with the lower 95%CI ≥1; a GMT ratio of 1.84 (1.57, 2.16) 
was observed for 2C+1O versus 3C+1C. For seroconversion rate, the lower 95%CIs 
of differences between immuno-comparative groups (2/3C+1O vs. 3C+1C) were all 
above the superiority criterion 0%. However, the non-inferiority criterion of 
the lower 95%CI of GMT ratio ≥2/3 was unfulfilled for 2C/3C+1O against BA.1 
versus 2C+0 against ancestral strain. Safety profiles were similar between 
groups, with no safety concerns identified.
CONCLUSION: The Omicron-adapted vaccine was well-tolerated and could elicit 
superior immune responses as compared with CoronaVac against Omicron, while it 
appeared inferior to CoronaVac against ancestral strain.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that presents with varied clinical manifestations 
ranging from asymptomatic or mild infections and pneumonia to severe cases 
associated with cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 
even death. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these differences are 
unclear, although exacerbated inflammatory sequelae resulting from infection 
have been implicated. While advanced aging is a known risk factor, the precise 
immune parameters that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly 
individuals are not understood. Here, we found aging-associated (age ≥61) 
intrinsic changes in T cell responses when compared to those from individuals 
aged ≤ 60, even among COVID-positive patients with mild symptoms. Specifically, 
when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro, peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell (PBMC) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from individuals aged ≥61 showed a diminished 
capacity to produce IFN-γ and IL-1β. Although they did not have severe disease, 
aged individuals also showed a higher frequency of PD-1+ cells and significantly 
diminished IFN-γ/PD-1 ratios among T lymphocytes upon SARS-CoV-2 peptide 
stimulation. Impaired T cell IL-1β expression coincided with reduced NLRP3 
levels in T lymphocytes. However, the expression of these molecules was not 
affected in the monocytes of individuals aged ≥61. Together, these data reveal 
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell intrinsic cytokine alterations in the 
individuals older than 61 and may provide new insights into dysregulated 
COVID-directed immune responses in the elderly.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a global pandemic 
by WHO after it spreads quickly around the world from its source city in Wuhan. 
Africa has some of the lowest documented SARS-CoV-2 incidences globally, with 
over 9 million confirmed cases as of December 2022. This may be due to efficient 
mitigation, outbreak response, or demographic traits. Surveillance capability 
may have suffered as nations changed funding, regulations, and testing plans. 
Therefore, this study was to document the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, its 
characteristics, and the socio-economic characteristics in the two mining 
districts of Solwezi and Kalumbila of Zambia.
METHODS: Between 28 March and 26 April 2021, a cross-sectional cluster-sample 
survey of households in two mining districts of Zambia was conducted. Twenty 
standard enumeration areas (SEAs) were randomly selected in Kansanshi (17 SEA) 
and Kalumbila (3 SEA) from a total of 67 SEA that encompass the two mines. 
Members of households aged <5 years were not eligible to participate in the 
survey. All participants that consented to participate in the interview were 
also asked to consent to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a rapid diagnostic 
test (RDT), which tested for recent infection and past exposure to the virus 
(IgM and IgG, respectively).
RESULT: Out of the total sample of 3,047 that were present for the interview, 
622 of them agreed to test for COVID-19. Of the total that tested for 
SARS-CoV-2, 2.6% were IgM positive while 9.0% were IgG positive. Despite the 
above results, 1,586 participants that agreed to the interview indicated a low 
self-risk assessment of getting COVID-19 (46.5%) or someone (45.5%). On the 
public health measures, participants who did handwashing more than usual 
(65.0%), not hand sanitizing more than usual (69.0%), not disinfecting surfaces 
in their households than usual (87.5%), not avoiding drinking from bars or 
nightclubs (90.6%), and not wearing a mask when out in public places (71.1%). In 
the logistic multivariable model, participants with age 24 years and above (AOR 
= 2.94; 95% CI = 1.10, 7.81) and having experienced symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 (AOR 
= 2.60; 95% CI: 1.33, 5.05) had a significant effect on testing positive for 
SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSION: Although the results showed that active COVID-19 prevalence in 
Solwezi and Kalumbila communities surrounding the two mines was low, exposure to 
infection was five times high. Government and mining firms should continue to 
sensitize the community members on the preventive measures of COVID-19 and 
continue with community testing so that all those positive but without symptoms 
can self-isolate and those with symptoms and sick can be admitted to the 
hospital.

INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 690 
million deaths worldwide. Different results concerning the death rates of the 
Delta and Omicron variants have been recorded. We aimed to assess the secular 
trend of case fatality rate (CFR), identify risk factors associated with 
mortality following COVID-19 diagnosis, and investigate the risks of mortality 
and hospitalization during Delta and Omicron waves in the United States.
METHODS: This study assessed 2,857,925 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in 
the United States from January 2020, to June 2022. The inclusion criterion was 
the presence of COVID-19 diagnostic codes in electronic medical record or a 
positive laboratory test of the SARS-CoV-2. Statistical analysis was bifurcated 
into two components, longitudinal analysis and comparative analysis. To assess 
the discrepancies in hospitalization and mortality rates for COVID-19, we 
identified the prevailing periods for the Delta and Omicron variants.
RESULTS: Longitudinal analysis demonstrated four sharp surges in the number of 
deaths and CFR. The CFR was persistently higher in males and older age. The CFR 
of Black and White remained higher than Asians since January 2022. In 
comparative analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and 
hospitalization were higher in Delta wave compared to the Omicron wave. Risk of 
all-cause mortality was found to be greater 14-30 days after a COVID-19 
diagnosis, while the likelihood of hospitalization was higher in the first 
14 days following a COVID-19 diagnosis in Delta wave compared with Omicron wave. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed the cumulative probability of mortality was 
approximately 2-fold on day 30 in Delta than in Omicron cases (log-rank 
p < 0.001). The mortality risk ratio between the Delta and Omicron variants was 
1.671 (95% Cl 1.615-1.729, log-rank p < 0.001). Delta also had a significantly 
increased mortality risk over Omicron in all age groups. The CFR of people aged 
above 80 years was extremely high as 17.33%.
CONCLUSION: Male sex and age seemed to be strong and independent risk factors of 
mortality in COVID-19. The Delta variant appears to cause more hospitalization 
and death than the Omicron variant.

The pandemic deeply changed young adults' life. Lockdown period and the social 
restrictions dramatically affected university students' mental health. The aim 
of our cross-sectional study was to describe psychological well-being, future 
anxiety (FA), and health complaints (HCs) in a sample of 3,001 students of the 
University of Florence in the middle of the first two pandemic waves. We 
assessed the role of subjective social status, chronic diseases, sense of 
coherence (SoC), and digital health literacy (DHL) as predictors of 
psychological well-being, FA, and HCs. Students expressed high levels of FA and 
reported being disturbed by not being able to achieve their desired future 
goals. About 40% reported a low or a very low well-being and 19.1% experienced 
two or more subjective health complaints more than once a week. The likelihood 
of having a better mental health status significantly increased with increasing 
SoC and among males. Subjective Social Status proved to be a predictor for FA. 
Enhancing SoC could improve the health status of the university students during 
the pandemic and beyond.

Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) belongs to the family Herpesviridae. Herpes zoster 
(HZ) is caused by reactivation of latent VZV. It is associated with risk factors 
such as immunosenescence, immunosuppressive pathologies and pharmacological 
treatments. Patients with these risk factors are more likely to be hospitalized. 
Increases in HZ hospitalizations have been reported in many countries in recent 
years. The objective of this study is to estimate hospitalization rates, 
mortality rates and costs due to HZ during the worst years of the COVID-19 
pandemic in Spain (2020-2021). This is a descriptive study based on an analysis 
of information from the Minimum Basic Dataset and coded according to the Spanish 
version of the 10th International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM). 
Hospitalization, mortality and case-fatality rates, and median length of 
hospitalization were calculated.. The hospitalization rate was 14.4 cases per 
100,000 inhabitants, and the mortality rate was 1.3 cases per 100,000 
inhabitants. Both increased considerably with age. In this time period, 92.3% of 
the registered cases were people over 50 years of age. Nevertheless, during the 
COVID-19 pandemic period, hospitalization rate decreased and the mortality rate 
increased from previous years. HZ hospitalization and mortality rates are 
relevant issues in the public health of older people. It is highly recommended 
to evaluate new vaccination strategies against VZV to include the HZ vaccine for 
health care for elderly people, as well as to reduce the disease burden and 
associated risk factors. The estimation of HZ disease hospitalization costs were 
€100,433,904.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with reduced risk of acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS); however, several studies have reported cardiovascular 
complications following vaccination. We aimed to investigate the effect of 
COVID-19 vaccination status on the treatment and outcome of ACS patients.
METHODS: The study was based on the 2021 Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey. 
Patients were stratified into two groups according to COVID-19 vaccination 
status, vaccinated compared to unvaccinated. Patients who had received at least 
2 vaccination doses up to 1 week prior to ACS hospitalization were considered 
vaccinated. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1261 patients with ACS were included, of whom 990 (78.5%) 
were vaccinated. Vaccinated patients were older and less frequently smokers. 
There were no significant differences in coronary reperfusion rates and 
treatment with guideline-based medical therapy during hospital stay and at 
discharge. The primary endpoint of 1-year all-cause mortality occurred in 38 
(3.8%) and 14 (5.2%) patients in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups 
respectively (P = 0.42). 30-day MACE occurred in 94 (9.5%) in the vaccinated 
patients compared to 31 (11.5%) in the unvaccinated group (P = 0.39). These 
results remained similar following adjustment for confounders.
CONCLUSION: There was no association between COVID-19 vaccination status and the 
outcomes of patients with ACS. Our findings provide support for the 
cardiovascular safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in patients at high 
cardiovascular risk.

BACKGROUND: Children's physical activity in England is more dependent on active 
clubs after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear how the COVID-19 
pandemic and related cost-of-living crisis have impacted on active club 
participation, costs and provision. This mixed-methods natural experiment 
explored school-based and community-based active clubs after lockdowns, using a 
unique combination of data sources to highlight implications for policy and 
practice post-COVID-19.
METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire data on school and community active clubs 
were collected from 10-11-year-old children pre-COVID-19 in 2017-18 (N = 1,296; 
50 schools), in 2021 (N = 393; 23 schools), and 2022 (N = 463; 27 schools). Club 
participation and attendance frequency were modelled using logistic and Poisson 
mixed effects models, adjusted for child age, gender and household education. In 
2021 and 2022, parents reported expenditure on community-based clubs and schools 
provided data on school-based club provision, with data summarised 
descriptively. Qualitative data were collected in 2021 and 2022, with one-to-one 
interviews with school staff (N = 18) and parents (N = 43), and twelve child 
focus groups (N = 92), and analysed using the framework method.
RESULTS: School-based active club participation was higher in 2022 compared to 
pre-pandemic (50% /43%), while community-based club participation was lower 
(74%/80%). Children attended 0.3 fewer clubs per week. Those from lower 
education households were less likely to participate in both types of active 
clubs, and girls less likely to attend community clubs. In 2022, the median cost 
of community and school club sessions were £6.67 and £3.88 respectively, with 
52% of school-based clubs free to parents. Schools offered an average of 3.4 
active clubs per week for 10-11-year-olds in 2022, with 34% partly/wholly 
subsidised. Qualitative analysis highlighted the impact of the cost-of-living 
crisis and COVID-19 pandemic on family resources, encouraging a shift to more 
affordable and convenient school-based active clubs, which negatively impacted 
the community-based active club environment. However, many schools struggled to 
meet this increased demand.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasise the importance for policymakers to support 
schools to meet increased demand for clubs and community clubs to increase 
affordable and convenient physical activity opportunities. Targeted support is 
needed to prevent socioeconomic and gender inequalities.

BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) imaging and artificial intelligence 
(AI)-based analyses have aided in the diagnosis and prediction of the severity 
of COVID-19. However, the potential of AI-based CT quantification of pneumonia 
in assessing patients with COVID-19 has not yet been fully explored. This study 
aimed to investigate the potential of AI-based CT quantification of COVID-19 
pneumonia to predict the critical outcomes and clinical characteristics of 
patients with residual lung lesions.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1,200 hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19 from four hospitals. The incidence of critical outcomes (requiring 
the support of high-flow oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation or death) and 
complications during hospitalization (bacterial infection, renal failure, heart 
failure, thromboembolism, and liver dysfunction) was compared between the groups 
of pneumonia with high/low-percentage lung lesions, based on AI-based CT 
quantification. Additionally, 198 patients underwent CT scans 3 months after 
admission to analyze prognostic factors for residual lung lesions.
RESULTS: The pneumonia group with a high percentage of lung lesions (N = 400) 
had a higher incidence of critical outcomes and complications during 
hospitalization than the low percentage group (N = 800). Multivariable analysis 
demonstrated that AI-based CT quantification of pneumonia was independently 
associated with critical outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.5, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 5.59-19.7), as well as with oxygen requirement (aOR 
6.35, 95% CI 4.60-8.76), IMV requirement (aOR 7.73, 95% CI 2.52-23.7), and 
mortality rate (aOR 6.46, 95% CI 1.87-22.3). Among patients with follow-up CT 
scans (N = 198), the multivariable analysis revealed that the pneumonia group 
with a high percentage of lung lesions on admission (aOR 4.74, 95% CI 
2.36-9.52), older age (aOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.16-5.51), female sex (aOR 2.41, 95% CI 
1.13-5.11), and medical history of hypertension (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.09-4.50) 
independently predicted persistent residual lung lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: AI-based CT quantification of pneumonia provides valuable 
information beyond qualitative evaluation by physicians, enabling the prediction 
of critical outcomes and residual lung lesions in patients with COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and evaluation of its 
symptoms require in-person clinical examination. Remote evaluation of PD 
symptoms is desirable, especially during a pandemic such as the coronavirus 
disease 2019 pandemic. One potential method to remotely evaluate PD motor 
impairments is video-based analysis. In this study, we aimed to assess the 
feasibility of predicting the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
score from gait videos using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
METHODS: We retrospectively obtained 737 consecutive gait videos of 74 patients 
with PD and their corresponding neurologist-rated UPDRS scores. We utilized a 
CNN model for predicting the total UPDRS part III score and four subscores of 
axial symptoms (items 27, 28, 29, and 30), bradykinesia (items 23, 24, 25, 26, 
and 31), rigidity (item 22) and tremor (items 20 and 21). We trained the model 
on 80% of the gait videos and used 10% of the videos as a validation dataset. We 
evaluated the predictive performance of the trained model by comparing the 
model-predicted score with the neurologist-rated score for the remaining 10% of 
videos (test dataset). We calculated the coefficient of determination (R2) 
between those scores to evaluate the model's goodness of fit.
RESULTS: In the test dataset, the R2 values between the model-predicted and 
neurologist-rated values for the total UPDRS part III score and subscores of 
axial symptoms, bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor were 0.59, 0.77, 0.56, 0.46, 
and 0.0, respectively. The performance was relatively low for videos from 
patients with severe symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low predictive performance of the model for the total 
UPDRS part III score, it demonstrated relatively high performance in predicting 
subscores of axial symptoms. The model approximately predicted the total UPDRS 
part III scores of patients with moderate symptoms, but the performance was low 
for patients with severe symptoms owing to limited data. A larger dataset is 
needed to improve the model's performance in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: People with a severe mental illness (SMI) have shorter life 
expectancy and poorer quality of life compared to the general population. Most 
years lost are due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and various 
types of cancer. We co-designed an intervention to mitigate this health problem 
with key stakeholders in the area, which centred on an extended consultations 
for people with SMI in general practice. This study aimed to1) investigate 
general practitioners' (GPs) experience of the feasibility of introducing 
extended consultations for patients with SMI, 2) assess the clinical content of 
extended consultations and how these were experienced by patients, and 3) 
investigate the feasibility of identification, eligibility screening, and 
recruitment of patients with SMI.
METHODS: The study was a one-armed feasibility study. We planned that seven 
general practices in northern Denmark would introduce extended consultations 
with their patients with SMI for 6 months. Patients with SMI were identified 
using practice medical records and screened for eligibility by the patients' GP. 
Data were collected using case report forms filled out by practice personnel and 
via qualitative methods, including observations of consultations, individual 
semi-structured interviews, a focus group with GPs, and informal conversations 
with patients and general practice staff.
RESULTS: Five general practices employing seven GPs participated in the study, 
which was terminated 3 ½ month ahead of schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
General practices attempted to contact 57 patients with SMI. Of these, 38 
patients (67%) attended an extended consultation, which led to changes in the 
somatic health care plan for 82% of patients. Conduct of the extended 
consultations varied between GPs and diverged from the intended conduct. 
Nonetheless, GPs found the extended consultations feasible and, in most cases, 
beneficial for the patient group. In interviews, most patients recounted the 
extended consultation as beneficial.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that it is feasible to introduce extended 
consultations for patients with SMI in general practice, which were also found 
to be well-suited for eliciting patients' values and preferences. Larger studies 
with a longer follow-up period could help to assess the long-term effects and 
the best implementation strategies of these consultations.

The impact of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on the progression of subsequent 
infections has been unclear. Using a convenience sample of 94,812 longitudinal 
RT-qPCR measurements from anterior nares and oropharyngeal swabs, we identified 
71 individuals with two well-sampled SARS-CoV-2 infections between March 11th, 
2020, and July 28th, 2022. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics of first 
vs. second infections in this group, adjusting for viral variant, vaccination 
status, and age. Relative to first infections, second infections usually 
featured a faster clearance time. Furthermore, a person's relative (rank-order) 
viral clearance time, compared to others infected with the same variant, was 
roughly conserved across first and second infections, so that individuals who 
had a relatively fast clearance time in their first infection also tended to 
have a relatively fast clearance time in their second infection (Spearman 
correlation coefficient: 0.30, 95% credible interval (0.12, 0.46)). These 
findings provide evidence that, like vaccination, immunity from a prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection shortens the duration of subsequent acute SARS-CoV-2 
infections principally by reducing viral clearance time. Additionally, there 
appears to be an inherent element of the immune response, or some other host 
factor, that shapes a person's relative ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 infection 
that persists across sequential infections.

21 Does the number of pre-operative assessments of strabismus patients influence 
the surgical outcome?

Surgical strabismus traditionally attended for several face-to-face (FTF) 
measurements before being listed for surgery. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a 
streamlined care-pathway was adapted to reduce FTF contact time to protect staff 
and manage floor-flow. Patients were listed for surgery after just one 
face-to-face orthoptic assessment, followed by a further measurement at 
pre-assessment.This is a case cohort to look at surgical outcome of all 
consecutive exotropia patients who underwent re-do horizontal muscle surgery 
over the last 14 years, from a surgeon's prospective database.65 patients had 
surgery before the pandemic (Group-A) and 28 since the pandemic (Group-B). The 
mean age was 34.9 and 39.1 years respectively. The mean pre-operative near-angle 
was 37.5 prism dioptres (PD) and distance-angle of 34.8PD for group-A. Group B 
was 39.3PD for near and 36.3PD for distance. 89.1% in group-A and 89.2% in 
group-B had suppression. Postoperative alignment within 15PD was achieved, after 
a combination of fixed and adjustable procedures, for 75.4% in group-A and 88.5% 
in group-B with predominant adjustable procedure. The mean 2-weeks 
post-operative alignment was -1PD for group-A and -1.3PD for group-B. Group-A 
had an average of 3.6 measurements, with 3.3 doctor consultant prior to surgery 
and group-B had 2 FTF orthoptics and 1 FTF doctor contact.44.4% reduction in 
face-to-face orthoptics contact-time and 69.7% less consultant contact-time had 
not negatively affected the patient surgical outcome.Strabismus surgery can be 
considered in selected cases with less FTF pre-operatively and improve 
cost-efficiency of our adult strabismus service with 'block-contract' status.

26 Virtual strabismus clinic: an alternative model of care during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Addenbrooke's Hospital introduced a virtual strabismus clinic in March 2021 to 
manage patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to explore the 
feasibility and utility of this care model by evaluating its effectiveness in 
delivering patient care.Clinic data from April 2021 to April 2022 were 
retrospectively analysed, including patient demographics, referral information 
and outcomes. All patients underwent an initial assessment by a specialist 
orthoptist, preceding virtual review by a consultant ophthalmologist.The clinic 
saw 114 patients between the ages of 12 and 95 during this period, with an 
increasing number of patients seen per month. Within two months of the clinic's 
inception, wait times reduced by 59%: from 30.2 weeks to 12.5 weeks, remaining 
constant thereafter. Most referrals came from optometrists, with diplopia and 
identification of new or recurring strabismus being the most common complaint. 
Virtual review outcome varied significantly: 30.7% of patients were discharged, 
16.7% listed for surgery, 34.2% received a repeat FTF review and a further 18.4% 
received a review virtually.Following its inception, the virtual clinic was able 
to effectively accommodate patients despite capacity restraints. This was partly 
achieved through the effective utilisation of specialised orthoptists. 
Subsequent virtual review by a consultant ophthalmologist achieved positive 
patient outcomes.Virtual clinics provide an opportunity to optimise patient care 
and maximise efficiency of clinical input. If applied appropriately, this model 
of patient care may reduce the NHS burden, improving wait times to facilitate 
faster intervention. Increasing consultant availability permits the treatment of 
a greater number of patients.

In this article we review the COVID-19 pandemic experience in Aotearoa New 
Zealand and consider the optimal ongoing response strategy. We note that this 
pandemic virus looks likely to result in future waves of infection that diminish 
in size over time, depending on such factors as viral evolution and population 
immunity. However, the burden of disease remains high with thousands of 
infections, hundreds of hospitalisations and tens of deaths each week, and an 
unknown burden of long-term illness (long COVID). Alongside this there is a 
considerable burden from other important respiratory illnesses, including 
influenza and RSV, that needs more attention. Given this impact and the 
associated health inequities, particularly for Māori and Pacific Peoples, we 
consider that an ongoing respiratory disease mitigation strategy is appropriate 
for New Zealand. As such, the previously described "vaccines plus" approach 
(involving vaccination and public health and social measures), should now be 
integrated with the surveillance and control of other important respiratory 
infections. Now is also a time for New Zealand to build on the lessons from the 
COVID-19 pandemic to enhance preparedness nationally and internationally. New 
Zealand's experience suggests elimination (or ideally exclusion) should be the 
default first choice for future pandemics of sufficient severity.

As SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) that evade immunity continue to emerge, 
next-generation adaptable COVID-19 vaccines which protect the respiratory tract 
and provide broader, more effective, and durable protection are urgently needed. 
Here, we have developed one such approach, a highly efficacious, intranasally 
delivered, trivalent measles-mumps-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MMS) vaccine 
candidate that induces robust systemic and mucosal immunity with broad 
protection. This vaccine candidate is based on three components of the MMR 
vaccine, a measles virus Edmonston and the two mumps virus strains [Jeryl Lynn 1 
(JL1) and JL2] that are known to provide safe, effective, and long-lasting 
protective immunity. The six proline-stabilized prefusion S protein (preS-6P) 
genes for ancestral SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and two important SARS-CoV-2 VoCs (Delta and 
Omicron BA.1) were each inserted into one of these three viruses which were then 
combined into a trivalent "MMS" candidate vaccine. Intranasal immunization of 
MMS in IFNAR1-/- mice induced a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgG response, 
cross-variant neutralizing antibodies, mucosal IgA, and systemic and 
tissue-resident T cells. Immunization of golden Syrian hamsters with MMS vaccine 
induced similarly high levels of antibodies that efficiently neutralized 
SARS-CoV-2 VoCs and provided broad and complete protection against challenge 
with any of these VoCs. This MMS vaccine is an efficacious, broadly protective 
next-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is readily adaptable to new 
variants, built on a platform with a 50-y safety record that also protects 
against measles and mumps.

Understanding factors that influence those who are initially COVID-19 vaccine 
hesitant to accept vaccination is valuable for the development of vaccine 
promotion strategies. Using Ipsos KnowledgePanel®, we conducted a national 
survey of adults aged 18 and older in the United States. We created a 
questionnaire to examine factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake over a 
longitudinal period ("Wave 1" in April 2021 and "Wave 2" in February 2022), and 
utilized weighted data provided by Ipsos to make the data nationally 
representative. Overall, 1189 individuals participated in the Wave 1 survey, and 
843 participants completed the Wave 2 survey (71.6% retention rate). Those who 
intended to be vaccinated as soon as possible ("ASAP") were overwhelmingly 
vaccinated by Wave 2 (96%, 95% CI: 92% to 100%). Of those who initially wished 
to delay vaccination until there was more experience with it ("Wait and See"), 
57% (95% CI: 47% to 67%) were vaccinated at Wave 2. Within the "Wait and See" 
cohort, those with income <$50,000 and those who had never received the 
influenza vaccine were significantly less likely to be vaccinated at Wave 2. 
Among those who initially indicated that they would not receive a COVID-19 
vaccine ("Non-Acceptors"), 28% (95% CI: 21% to 36%) were vaccinated at Wave 2. 
Those who believed COVID-19 was not a major problem in their community were 
significantly less likely to be vaccinated, while those with more favorable 
attitudes toward vaccines in general and public health strategies to decrease 
the impact of COVID-19 were significantly more likely to be vaccinated. Overall, 
barriers to vaccine uptake for the "Wait and See" cohort appear to be more 
practical, whereas barriers for the "Non-Acceptor" cohort seem to be more 
ideological. These findings will help target interventions to improve uptake of 
COVID-19 boosters and future novel vaccines.
